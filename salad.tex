\section{Wedding Brunch Gazpacho\index{appetizers and salads!gazpacho}}

\textit{This gazpacho recipe comes by way of Jen Tidy.  
We were first introduced 
to it during the ``day
after'' wedding brunch.  The amounts of ingredients are variable, so add to your
personal taste preferences.} 
\begin{ingredients}
celery \\
peeled and seeded cucumbers \\
scallions and/or onions \\
red and green peppers \\
minced garlic \\
$\sim 6$ tomatoes (canned are O.K.) \\
$\sim 1/2$ cup of red wine vinegar \\
$\sim 1/2$ cup of olive oil \\
1--1\,1/2 cups tomato juice or V8 \\
lemon juice \\
black pepper \\
tabasco or cayenne pepper \\
fresh cilantro
\end{ingredients}
Chop the celery, cucumbers onion, peppers, tomatoes, and garlic to a
consistency that you find happy.  A food processor may be used for ``soupy''
consistency.  Mix the red wine vinegar and olive oil (these should be in equal
amounts).  To this add the tomato juice (V8).  Add lemon juice, black pepper,
tabasco, and fresh cilantro.  Combine veggies and liquid ingredients in a glass
pitcher or other asthetically pleasing container.  Chill for several hours or
overnight.  Serve with crunchy bread and a lightish red wine.

\section{Frog Mustard Salad Dressing\index{appetizers and salads!dressings}}

\textit{This is a quick preparation dressing 
that can be prepared in about 10 minutes.  It makes 8--10 servings}.
\begin{ingredients}
1/2 cup dijon mustard \\
2 Tbsp.  red wine vinegar \\
1/4 tsp. salt \\
3/4 tsp. pepper \\
1 cup corn oil (or olive)
\end{ingredients}
The crouton ingredients are:
\begin{ingredients}
4 slices fine textured white bread \\
4 Tbsp.  butter \\
1 tsp. dried thyme \\
1/8 tsp. salt \\
dash of pepper \\
2 tsp. minced parsley
\end{ingredients}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{4in}

\end{wrapfigure}
To make the salad dressing wisk the mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small
bowl.  Gradually add oil.

To make the croutons preheat the oven to \oven{350}.  Trim crusts (if desired)
and cut slices into 1/2$''$ cubes.  Spread single layer on tray, bake for 10--15
minutes until dry and lightly brown.  Heat butter in a skillet.  Add croutons and
remaining ingredients and toss well.  Saut\'{e} 1--2 minutes over medium heat and
cool.  Kate says that good salad stuffs are greenleaf or romaine lettuce with
spinach.  Add tomatoes, cucumber, and other salad stuff as your heart desires. 
Another yummy thing is to add pieces of chicken\index{salads, chicken} ham, or 
turkey and other meats, which makes it taste almost like a bite-sized sandwich.
