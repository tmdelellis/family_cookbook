\begin{open}
  Here is a great one by Dotty Lindquist from her treasure trove food blog, \\
  \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}, where she writes: ``These are a Thanksgiving
  staple in my family, but I also bring them out as a heavy appetizer for
  parties, and sometimes as an extra special side for a cold November
  weeknight.  This recipe is for the ``Thanksgiving'' or ``Dinner Party''
  yield.  If you are cooking for fewer than \numrange{15}{20} people, I
  suggest downsizing the quantities.  Donâ€™t worry too much about measurement
  of ingredients: there is no wrong way to stuff a mushroom.  Use more of what
  you like, less of what you don't, and/or eliminate or substitute one cheese
  or vegetable for another.  It's all good, quite literally!''

  This one serves up to 20 people.  Prep time is \SI{40}{\minute} and cook
  time is \SI{30}{\minute}.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    6 \SI{1}{\quart} packages white or ``stuffing'' mushrooms\\
    \SI{1}{\pound} Italian sausage (mild or spicy---you choose!)\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} butter\\
    5 cloves garlic, minced\\
    8 stalks celery, diced\\
    \SI{2}{\cup} breadcrumbs (seasoned)\\
    \SI{2}{\cup} grated/shredded cheese (parmesan, asiago, Romano blend is
    nice)\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} marscapone\\
    salt and pepper to taste
\end{ingredients}
Wiggle the stems out of the mushroom caps and line up the caps on a baking sheet
(or two). Use a damp paper towel to wipe mushrooms clean of debris. Cover the
caps with a damp paper towel while you are making the filling to keep them
moist. Pop your stems into the food processor and pulse until they are minced.
Set aside in a bowl.

Brown sausage in a deep pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Empty browned
sausage into food processor and pulse until it is the same texture as the
mushroom caps.

Melt a stick of butter (\SI{1/2}{\cup}) into the pan that you used to brown the
sausage. No need to wash the pan in between uses. Add the diced celery, the
minced mushroom caps and minced garlic and simmer until the mushrooms are soft
and have changed color (from white to brown). Add the marscapone and stir.
Remove from heat.

Pour mushroom mixture into minced sausage, and stir. Add bread crumbs and grated
cheese. Stir until combined. Using a teaspoon, add stuffing into mushroom caps
until filled. Bake at \SI{350}{\degreeF} until the mushrooms have softened,
change color, are slightly browned on top and release some fluid onto the baking
sheet. Cool until you're able to handle them with bare hands, serve and enjoy (Fig.~\ref{fig:sausage-stuffed-mushrooms})!

the mustard mixture evenly over the rolls and cover with foil. Bake in
preheated oven until rolls are lightly browned and cheese is melted, about 30

    1 medium onion\\

\end{ingredients}

\protip{Pepperoncini peppers look similar to banana peppers, but they are
  rounder and more yellow and even the mildest has a little heat. (Editor's
  note: pepperoncini peppers are likely what you have been eating on hoagies
  forever, thinking that they were banana peppers)}
%
Chop the onion, peppers, lettuce, tomato, deli meats and cheeses into bite
sized pieces. Combine into a large bowl and add mayonnaise, oil, oregano,
basil, and flakes. Stir until everything is evenly mixed. Refrigerate until
ready to serve. When serving, carve out the center of the bread loaf and safe
the scraps to make more bite sized pieces for dipping. Place hoagie dip in
bread bowl and serve surrounded by bread pieces for dipping.
