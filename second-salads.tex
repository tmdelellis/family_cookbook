    Another great one from \url{myrunawaykitchen.com} by Dot Lindquist who writes: ``These are a Thanksgiving staple in my family, but I also bring them out as a heavy appetizer for parties, and sometimes as an extra special side for a cold November weeknight.  This recipe is for the ``Thanksgiving'' or ``Dinner Party'' yield.  If you are cooking for fewer than \numrange{15}{20} people, I suggest downsizing the quantities.  Donâ€™t worry too much about measurement of ingredients: there is no wrong way to stuff a mushroom.  Use more of what you like, less of what you don't, and/or eliminate or substitute one cheese or vegetable for another.  It's all good, quite literally!''

    This one serves up to 20 people.  Prep time is \SI{40}{\minute} and cook time is \SI{30}{\minute}.

%%
\begin{ingredients}
    6 \SI{1}{\quart} packages white or ``stuffing'' mushrooms\\
    \SI{1}{\pound} Italian sausage (mild or spicy---you choose!)\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} butter\\
    5 cloves garlic, minced\\
    8 stalks celery, diced\\
    \SI{2}{\cup} breadcrumbs (seasoned)\\
    \SI{2}{\cup} grated/shredded cheese (parmesan, asiago, Romano blend is
    nice)\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} marscapone\\
    salt and pepper to taste
\end{ingredients}
Wiggle the stems out of the mushroom caps and line up the caps on a baking sheet
(or two). Use a damp paper towel to wipe mushrooms clean of debris. Cover the
caps with a damp paper towel while you are making the filling to keep them
moist. Pop your stems into the food processor and pulse until they are minced.
Set aside in a bowl.

Brown sausage in a deep pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Empty browned
sausage into food processor and pulse until it is the same texture as the
mushroom caps.

Melt a stick of butter (\SI{1/2}{\cup}) into the pan that you used to brown the
sausage. No need to wash the pan in between uses. Add the diced celery, the
minced mushroom caps and minced garlic and simmer until the mushrooms are soft
and have changed color (from white to brown). Add the marscapone and stir.
Remove from heat.

Pour mushroom mixture into minced sausage, and stir. Add bread crumbs and grated
cheese. Stir until combined. Using a teaspoon, add stuffing into mushroom caps
until filled. Bake at \SI{350}{\degreeF} until the mushrooms have softened,
change color, are slightly browned on top and release some fluid onto the baking
sheet. Cool until you're able to handle them with bare hands, serve and enjoy!
