\chapter{Foreward}

Finally, we know all of you have been holding your breath this last year
in anticipation of the release of the Family Cookbook.  Well Ma'
Flanders, you can rest at ease, because IT is here.  We hope everyone
enjoys each others contributions.  Kate and Tom had a good time putting it
together, well that isn't entirely true.  Let's say we enjoyed the
THOUGHT of doing it, and, of course, now that the deed is done we are
very happy with the results.  

Now that we have a `base' manuscript from which to work, inclusions will
be welcome.  We foresee that many editions of the family cookbook could
grace the bookshelfs, cabinets, and, in some cases, trash cans of our
once and future homes.  Keep the recipes and corrections comin' and we'll
eventually work them in two the second edition due out in April, 2034.

Illustrations in the cookbook are meant to spice things up. Both Kate and
Tom contributed artwork.  We hope you think that they are moderately
funny.  In the future any contributions in this area are welcome.  Some
of you may be wondering, `Why no pictures?'  Well, we felt that the realm
of photography was frought with far too much peril.  What if we forgot a
picture of so-and-so or `That's a horrible picture of me to present to
the whole family!'  Frankly, we didn't want to deal with the possibility
of such horrors, so, artwork it was.

Well, that's all our comments for now as we are tired of doing this and
have no energy left to write, format, or look at this in general.  Please
try the recipes and let us and others know which are keepers (hopefully
all) and which need modification.  May all enjoy and we look forward to
hearing from all of you  in the near future!  Happy Holidays!

\section{Family Trees}

We realized while writing this recipe book that many of you don't know
people from either Tom's or Kate's extended families.  To resolve this
Tom proposed a biblical-style section, ie. Donald begot Dodge who was the
Father of Kate...  Kate, on the other hand hated that format, and, for
once, Tom agreed.  Therefore, we settled on family trees because they
remind Tom of Feynman Diagrams and because Kate thinks they look like
something having to do with weather.  Anyway, these are meant for people
from one side of the hill to see who is related to who on the other side.
They are not conclusive and only reflect the situation as it is now.
