\textbf{From the first edition: }
Finally, we know all of you have been holding your breath this last year
in anticipation of the release of the Family Cookbook.  Well Ma'
Flanders, you can rest at ease, because IT is here.  We hope everyone
enjoys each others' contributions.  We had a good time putting it
together -- well that isn't entirely true.  Let's say we enjoyed the
THOUGHT of doing it, and, of course, now that the deed is done we are
very happy with the results.

Illustrations in the cookbook are meant to spice things up. Both Kate and
Tom contributed artwork.  We hope you think that they are moderately
funny.  In the future any contributions in this area are welcome.  Some
of you may be wondering, `Why no pictures?'  Well, we felt that the realm
of photography was fraught with far too much peril.  What if we forgot a
picture of so-and-so or `That's a horrible picture of me to present to
the whole family!'  Frankly, we didn't want to deal with the possibility
of such horrors, so, artwork it was.


\textbf{The second edition:}
Wow the technology of creating a book have sure changed since we created the first edition. And thank goodness!
This edition is a `base' manuscript from which to work, but in theory we could include more submissions when you send them. In reality,  this utopia where many editions of the family cookbook could grace the bookshelves, cabinets, and, in some cases, trash cans of our once and future homes is limited by our time and motivation to enter them. Seriously though, this does mean that corrections can be added at any time and you can grab the latest pdf whenever you want to cook something. And of course, you are welcome to keep the recipes comin' and we'll eventually work them into the third edition, due out in April, 2034.

This time it was easy to add pictures as well as artwork, so that adds a nice touch, that to all who provided some visual interest along with the recipes! Well, that's all our comments for now as we are tired of doing this and
have no energy left to write, format, or look at this in general.  Please
try the recipes and let the authors know if you enjoyed them. Sending our love and wishes for some good home cooking!

\section{Family Information}

\subsection{List of Contributors}

In the last cookbook we added family trees at the end so that everyone could see how folks are connected across families, but we were afraid to do this time as its too easy to misspell, omit, etc. You would not believe the existential questions we pursued. For example, do we include the now passed on relatives in the tree, or only if we reference them in a recipe? Do we use the traditional maiden names often used in trees, or current names? Proper names or commmon? What are the chances we will swap them inadvertently (high).  Instead we provide you with a list of contributors of recipes, and their relationship to us, the authors and we used the name they gave us when sending the recipe. If made a mistake, we apologize!

%\subsection{Family Trees}

%We realized while writing this recipe book that many of you don't know people from either Tom's or Kate's extended families.  To resolve this Tom proposed a biblical-style section, ie. Donald begot Dodge who was the Father of Kate...  Kate, on the other hand hated that format, and, for once, Tom agreed.  Therefore, we settled on family trees because they remind Tom of Feynman Diagrams and because Kate thinks they look like something having to do with weather.  Anyway, these are meant for people from one side of the hill to see who is related to who on the other side. They are not conclusive and only reflect the situation as it is now.
