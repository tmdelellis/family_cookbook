\index{Evans!Scott}

\begin{open}
  I hope you're prepared for this.  This recipe from Scott Evans makes a {\em
  thick} and {\em spicy} chili.  In the word's of the author ``It is pretty
  spicy.''  This is one of those recipes that should include a Disney-style
  warning label, ``\textellipsis those with heart conditions or over the age of
  sixty-five...etc. etc.''  This is this recipe's first time in print so some
  experimentation may be required.  Supposedly this is a campout recipe, however
  I see no way that anyone could possibly carry all these ingredients. The
  recipe makes about 16 servings or less for REALLY big people.  Good luck and
  here it goes.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{3}{\pound} of hot Italian sausage (ie. Hot Cincinnati Brand, that homer) \\
  \SI{3}{\pound} bacon \\
  3 large onions \\
  3 bell peppers (2 green, 1 red) \\
  \numrange{4}{5} cloves of garlic \\
  \numrange{4}{5} hot peppers (a cornucopia of jalape\~{n}os, habaneros, and
  others) \\
  3 cans Italian pear tomatoes \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} olive oil \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} mustard powder \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} celery seed \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} chili powder \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} bay leaves \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} Worcester sauce \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} vinegar \\
  red wine \\
  water \\
  salt and pepper
\end{ingredients}
Start with a large Dutch oven and a campfire right after breakfast.  Fry the
sausage and set aside.  Fry the bacon and set aside.  Leave a bit of grease in
the pot and add the minced garlic followed by the roughly chopped onions and
bell peppers (no bell pepper seeds).  Chop the hot peppers and add to the pot,
remember that the seeds make the dish VERY spicy.  Add olive oil as needed.

%%
Add about one Tbsp full each of: mustard powder, celery seed, Worcester sauce,
vinegar, and chili powder.  This may require some experimentation to alter to
your taste.  Stir and cook until onions become clear and peppers begin to
soften.  Add up to one cup of red wine.  Next add tomatoes and juices.  Stir
and chop tomatoes.  Add sausage, bacon, and two bay leaves.  Season with salt
and pepper.  Now everything should look a bit like chunky soup, but don't
worry.

Let the chili simmer over low heat for a minimum of three hours, but try for
eight (trust Scott on this one). Check periodically and stir.  If mixture
thickens too much add some water.  Taste and adjust to preference.

Serve with shredded cheddar cheese and garlic bread.  This recipe freezes well
in personalized zip-lock bags (In case you're not hungry enough to eat six
pounds of meat in one sitting).

\begin{open}
  This from Kate's brother Don, and he got it from his friend Dawn Ollila. The honey/brown sugar and cinnamon addition is what makes it taste so special.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon}olive oil \\
  1 onion \\
  1 green pepper \\
  2 cloves of minced garlic \\
  1 tomato\\
  1 large or two small carrots OR \SI{1/4}{\cup} cup lentil beans \\
  1 or 2 cans of tomato sauce \\
  thyme \\
  basil \\
  oregano \\
  rosemary \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} honey or brown sugar \\
  cinnamon \\
  salt and pepper
\end{ingredients}
\Saute the 4 vegetables in olive oil, adding them as ordered above. When the
onion is clear and the tomato is soft, add the tomato sauce.  Bring to a
simmer. The sauce is now tasty, but to thin to stick to the pasta.  Choose
either the carrots or lentils to give it body. Lentils add a great dark,
almost meaty, flavor but you will need to boil them in 4 times their
measurement in boiling water for \numrange{45}{90} minutes first (no
presoaking required). Do not add them to the sauce until they are bean-like
mush. or, you can grate the carrot as finely as you have the technology to do
and add to the sauce. The taste is minimal, but the texture is great. Add the
rest of the ingredients and adjust to taste. Add just enough cinnamon to make
your guests look at you funny and say, ``What did you put in this?'' The
flavor actually works quite well.

  From Fermi, this is Betsy's favorite.  Tom: Actually I really don't

  ``peachy chicken'' is not a southern thing.  Kate: When Tom and I were first
  married (Tom interjects: forty years ago) I made a chicken dish with fruit.
  He honestly thought I was trying to annoy him (how did he know?).

  This is from Martha and Dodge, and Kate. Kate's addition is only the
  rosemary and measured amounts, for convenience (and my subtractions are
  those nasty onions) No one cares what or how much you put in, as long as you
  are happy. This is one of those recipes that you put some in, then you take
  some out (Nana, does this sound familiar?) This is also the kind of recipe
  where you vary it based on what you like or what's sitting in the fridge!
  It's best when you have leftover gravy along with meat from a past meal.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{2}{\cup} chopped meat (roast lamb, beef, or chicken)\\
  \numrange{3}{4} cubed and peeled potatoes\\

\SIrange{1}{2}{\cup} each of your favorite vegetables, such as

Preheat oven to \SI{450}{\degreeF}. Boil potatoes until somewhat cooked through, about
15 minutes. In a flat-ish casserole (\SIrange{1.5}{2}{\quart}), layer meat,
vegetables, and potatoes. sprinkle spices over, and then flour. Add gravy
mixture; adjust so the liquid comes up about half the height of the
ingredients.  Top with crust, seal edges, and add fork holes or vents. Brown
for 15 minutes, then then lower temperature to \SI{350}{\degree} and bake for
45 minutes longer. I find that I have to cover it for the last
15 minutes or so to keep the crust from getting too brown.
