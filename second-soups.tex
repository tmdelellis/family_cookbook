    \SI{1}{\tblspoon} red chili paste (can also use 2 red chilies, chopped)\\
    \SI{2}{\tblspoon} coconut oil\\
    1 lime, zested and juiced\\
    \SI{1}{\tblspoon} fish sauce\\
    \SI{4}{\cup} chicken stock\\
    1 can (\SI{13.5}{\fluidounce}) coconut milk\\
    \SI{2}{\cup} shredded chicken
\end{ingredients}
For garnish:
\begin{ingredients}
    1 bunch of cilantro leaves chopped\\
    \numrange{4}{5} green onions, thinly sliced, both white and green parts\\

Combine garlic, onion, red pepper, ginger paste, lemongrass paste, red curry

process until a paste forms. Add the paste to a medium pot and fry it for a

\section{Butternut Squash Soup}

    More from Dot Lindquist and \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}! According to Dot, ``This soup (with bacon and bread) eats like a meal and will warm your belly and keep the rest of your bread in your wallet\textellipsis have you noticed how super-cheap butternut squash is!?  They are practically giving it away.  This soup freezes and reheats well and is a treat for lunch, too!'' (Note: we make no promises about the future price of butternut squash).

    This makes 15 servings, takes \SI{25}{\minute} of prep time and \SI{45}{\minute} of cooking time.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    4  apples---any variety\\
    4  med sized yellow onions\\
    3  med sized butternut squash\\
    \SIrange{6}{8}{\cup} stock (chicken or vegetable)\\
    drizzle  extra virgin olive oil\\
    \SI{1/2}{\teaspoon}  nutmeg\\
    \SI{1/2}{\teaspoon}  sage\\
    \SI{1.75}{\pound} thick cut bacon (I like applewood smoked)
\end{ingredients}
Set your oven to \SI{375}{\degreeF} and roast your butternut squash. You can do
this simply by
\begin{description}
    \item[Option One] cutting long-ways, scooping out the insides, drizzle with
    olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and place it cut-side down on a
    baking sheet
    \item[Option Two] you can do it the way shown above---halve
    your squash, scoop out the insides, peel and cube it, spread into a pan and
    drizzle with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper
\end{description}
Once the squash is tender (if you can easily stick a fork into it, it's done), you either have to scoop out the roasted squash from the outer shell, or you have to put the work in up front and peel ahead of time. Your choice! Option one is much quicker\textellipsis if you can afford to wait for the squash to cool before you scoop it. Option two is quicker if you have lovely teenage nieces who don't mind peeling for you!!%%

Dice your onions, peel and dice your apples. Melt diced apples and onions
together with a drizzle of olive oil in the bottom of your soup pot, over medium
heat, until wilted and aromatic. Add sage, butternut squash, and nutmeg, and
stir. Cover mixture with stock, and bring to a boil. Then, reduce heat. Blend
with immersion blender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Don't forget the bacon! I like to lay bacon out flat on a baking sheet and stick
it into the oven while the squash is roasting. I let it crisp up, then drain off
the excess fat and spread on paper towel. Chop it up when it's cool and set on
the side, to be served atop your soup! For an extra decadent treat, add a dollop
of sour cream, creme fraiche, or heavy cream right into your soup bowl and then
sprinkle on your bacon. Yuuuuummm. Serve with warm, crusty bread and enjoy!
