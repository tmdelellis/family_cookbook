Using a strainer that fits into a deep bowl, fill with finely cut fresh spearmint or peppermint leaves. Boil for ten minutes equal measures of water and granulated sugar, approximately 1\SI{1/2}{\cup} each. Pour directly over the mint and allow to cool. Remove the strainer and add the juice of one or more lemons and the juice of one or more oranges. Wonderful over ice cream, in iced tea, or on a simple cake aching for a hint of mint.

\section{Southern Pecan Pie\index{treats!southern pecan pie}}
\index{Johnson!Martha}

\begin{open}
    Hey y'all from Martha, this is from an ancient out of print Better Homes and
    Garden Cookbook One can double the sin by brushing the crust with a dark
    chocolate glaze before adding the filling, but it's pretty wonderful as is!
    And so easy! Either a pie crust mix, or the real thing work equally well.
    The main thing is to have fresh pecans.

\begin{open}
    This is one of the many amazing recipes you can find at
    \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}, Dot Lindquist's cooking blog.  We agree that
    gingerbread is, if not the King, at least cake royalty.  This recipe makes
    \numrange{14}{16} slices, takes \SI{25}{\minute} of prep time and about
    \SI{1}{\hour} of cooking time.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1/2}{\cup}  granulated sugar\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup}  unsalted butter\\
    1 large egg\\
    \SI{1}{\cup} molasses\\
    1 large orange, zested and juiced\\
    2 \SI{1/2}{\cup}s  all purpose flour\\
    1 \SI{1/2}{\cup}spoon  baking soda\\
    \SI{2}{\teaspoon} cinnamon\\
    \SI{2}{\teaspoon} ground ginger\\
    \SI{3/4}{\teaspoon}   ground cloves\\

Preheat oven to \SI{350}{\degreeF}. Grease and lightly flour the inside of your
baking pan. I like a bundt pan for this recipe, but you could use a
\SI{9x13}{\inch} pan, \SI{9x9}{\inch}, or even make cupcakes. Whatever your
little heart desires. If you're using cupcake papers or a parchment lining in
your pan or baking dish, no need to grease and flour the pan.

If possible, use room-temperature butter. If your room is very cold, or you
forgot to leave a pound of butter on your countertop for baking, pop your butter
into the microwave for \SI{10}{\second} intervals until it's mushy but not
liquid. Cream butter and sugar together in the stand mixer with the paddle
attachment, or with the handheld mixer.

Add egg and molasses and mix, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as
you go. In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: flour, baking
soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Add orange zest. Add dry ingredients to
the wet ingredients and mix until well blended. Add the \SI{1/2}{\cup} hot water
and the juice from your orange (should be about \SI{1/2}{\cup}, making the total
amount of liquid added in this step equal to one cup).

Bake in preheated oven for one hour or until a toothpick in the center comes out
clean and the cake springs back against your finger when you press into it.

Remove from pan and cool before frosting.

\section{OMG Avocado Chocolate Mousse\index{treats!OMG avocado chocolate
mousse}}
\index{Lindquist!Dot}

\begin{open}
    Another one from \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}.  In Dot's words, ``You’re not going to believe how simple this is to make and how eye-poppingly great it tastes… and the silky texture: OMG.  All you need is a food processor for this one.  Unless you like to slather it with real whipped cream, in which case you’ll also want an electric mixer of some kind.  I have been known to whip by hand, yes, but only when no motorized option is available!''

    Also, as pointed out by Dot, this recipe only uses healthy fats, so enjoy almost guilt free; although frankly, we highly encourage the use of all fats in our cookbook!
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    4 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted\\
    \SI{8}{\ounce} semisweet chocolate, melted (baker’s chocolate or chips are fine---you can use a double boiler method if you want, but it's ok to melt this stuff, covered, in the microwave in \SI{30}{\second} increments, stirring until smooth)\\
    \SI{6}{\tblspoon} cocoa powder\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} milk of any variety\\
    \SI{2}{\teaspoon} vanilla\\
    \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} salt\\
    \SI{3/4}{\cup} maple syrup
\end{ingredients}
Just combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until it’s as smooth
as a chocolate silk dream.  (Add maple syrup to the mixture last, to your
desired sweetness level, pulsing until completely incorporated.)

\minisection{Whipped Cream}

\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1}{\quart} ``heavy'' or ``whipping'' cream\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} confectioner's sugar\\
    \SI{2}{\teaspoon} vanilla
\end{ingredients}
Start your mixer on low or medium (so that the cream doesn't splatter all over creation) and gradually increase the speed as you gradually add sugar and vanilla.  Beat until soft peaks form.
