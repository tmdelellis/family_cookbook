%%
\begin{ingredients}
    fresh spearmint or peppermint leaves\\
    granulated sugar\\
    1 or more lemons\\
    1 or more oranges
\end{ingredients}
Using a strainer that fits into a deep bowl, fill with finely cut fresh
spearmint or peppermint leaves. Boil for ten minutes equal measures of water
and granulated sugar, approximately 1\SI{1/2}{\cup} each. Pour directly over
the mint and allow to cool. Remove the strainer and add the juice of one or
more lemons and the juice of one or more oranges. Wonderful over ice cream, in
iced tea, or on a simple cake aching for a hint of mint.

  Hey y'all, from Martha! This is from an ancient, out-of-print Better Homes
  and Garden Cookbook One can double the sin by brushing the crust with a dark
  chocolate glaze before adding the filling, but it's pretty wonderful as is!
  And so easy! Either a pie crust mix or the real thing work equally well. The
  main thing is to have fresh pecans.

\begin{ingredients}
    3 large eggs\\
    \SI{2/3}{\cup} sugar\\

    \SI{1}{\cup} pecan halves\\
    1 \SI{9}{\inch} unbaked pastry shell
\end{ingredients}
Beat eggs thoroughly with sugar, a dash of salt, corn syrup, and melted butter.
Add pecans. (Brush shell with melted chocolate if desired). Bake in moderate
oven (\SI{350}{\degreeF}) \SI{50}{\minute} or until a knife inserted near center
comes out clean. Cool.

    This is one of the many amazing recipes you can find at
    \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}, Dot Lindquist's cooking blog.  We agree that
    gingerbread is, if not the King, at least cake royalty.  This recipe makes
    \numrange{14}{16} slices, takes \SI{25}{\minute} of prep time and about
    \SI{1}{\hour} of cooking time.

\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1/2}{\cup}  granulated sugar\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup}  unsalted butter\\

Preheat oven to \SI{350}{\degreeF}. Grease and lightly flour the inside of your
baking pan. I like a bundt pan for this recipe, but you could use a
\SI{9x13}{\inch} pan, \SI{9x9}{\inch}, or even make cupcakes. Whatever your
little heart desires. If you're using cupcake papers or a parchment lining in
your pan or baking dish, no need to grease and flour the pan.

If possible, use room-temperature butter. If your room is very cold, or you
forgot to leave a pound of butter on your countertop for baking, pop your butter
into the microwave for \SI{10}{\second} intervals until it's mushy but not
liquid. Cream butter and sugar together in the stand mixer with the paddle
attachment, or with the handheld mixer.

Add egg and molasses and mix, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as
you go. In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: flour, baking
soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Add orange zest. Add dry ingredients to
the wet ingredients and mix until well blended. Add the \SI{1/2}{\cup} hot water
and the juice from your orange (should be about \SI{1/2}{\cup}, making the total
amount of liquid added in this step equal to one cup).

Bake in preheated oven for one hour or until a toothpick in the center comes out
clean and the cake springs back against your finger when you press into it.

Remove from pan and cool before frosting.

  From \url{myrunawaykitchen.com}, Dottie says, ``You’re not going to believe
  how simple this is to make and how eye-poppingly great it tastes… and the
  silky texture: OMG.  All you need is a food processor for this one.  Unless
  you like to slather it with real whipped cream, in which case you’ll also
  want an electric mixer of some kind.  I have been known to whip by hand,
  yes, but only when no motorized option is available!''

  Also, as pointed out by Dot, this recipe only uses healthy fats, so enjoy
  almost guilt free; although frankly, we highly encourage the use of all fats
  in this cookbook!

%%
\begin{ingredients}
    4 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted\\
    \SI{8}{\ounce} semisweet chocolate, melted (baker’s chocolate or chips are fine---you can use a double boiler method if you want, but it's ok to melt this stuff, covered, in the microwave in \SI{30}{\second} increments, stirring until smooth)\\
    \SI{6}{\tblspoon} cocoa powder\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} milk of any variety\\
    \SI{2}{\teaspoon} vanilla\\
    \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} salt\\
    \SI{3/4}{\cup} maple syrup
\end{ingredients}
Just combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until it’s as smooth
as a chocolate silk dream (Fig.~\ref{fig:mousse}).  (Add maple syrup to the
mixture last, to your desired sweetness level, pulsing until completely
incorporated.)

Start your mixer on low or medium (so that the cream doesn't splatter all over

vanilla.  Beat until soft peaks form.

    2 boxes of raspberry\\
    fresh mint leaves
\end{ingredients}
Chop the stalks of rhubarb, then simmer in a cup of water.  Cut a banana,
apple, and blood orange into equal sized chunks and add to the rhubarb.  Then
add minced fresh ginger, a spoonful of cinnamon, 2 cloves, a zested orange peel,
grated nutmeg, a spoonful of honey, molasses, brown sugar, butter, vanilla
extract, orange extract, and 2 boxes of raspberries.  You will need to play with
amounts for taste.  Add lots of fresh chopped mint near the end.

Pour it hot over vanilla ice cream or serve warm with plain goat milk yogurt.
Or, use the compote in a pie crust and add a few pieces of fruit on top!

\index{Evans!Kate}

\begin{open}
  This easy but delicious pie recipe came from a now out of print cookbook by
  Mable Hoffman titled ``Chocolate Cookery'' that Don got her for Christmas in
  1983. Kate wore it out from heavy use (thanks Don, you nailed it!) and
  recently procured a new copy from a secondhand seller. She makes this pie
  for most holiday events, and just this Christmas figured out how to avoid
  having the crust come out soggy! Regarding the pie shell, like Martha in the
  \ref{sec:pecanpie} recipe, the Betty Crocker mix works well here too.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1}{\cup} sugar\\
    \SI{1/4}{\cup} cornstarch\\
    \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} salt\\
    1\SI{1/2}{\cup} cold water\\
    3 eggs, lightly beaten \\
    \SI{3}{\ounce} semisweet chocolate \\
    \SI{2}{\tblspoon} butter \\
    \SI{1}{\teaspoon} vanilla extract\\
    1 9-inch pie shell, baked \\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} whipping cream
\end{ingredients}
In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Pour in water
and whisk until blended. Add eggs and chocolate and stir/wisk constantly until
thickened and smooth, about 10-20 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla
and butter. Cool a bit, then scoop and smooth into pie shell (NB: this bit
prevents the pudding from making the shell soggy). Refrigerate several hours
or until firm. Whip the cream and spread over chocolate and serve.

Preheat the oven to \SI{350}{\degreeF}.  Cream butter and sugar together; mix in

mixing well after each. If making the chocolate chip variation: add one bag
of mini chocolate chips.

Bake tablespoon-sized amounts on an ungreased cookie sheet for \SI{15}{\minute}.
For the chocolate chip variation, put Decorator's sugar on the tops prior to
baking. Cool on a baking rack (Fig.~\ref{fig:ricotta-cookies}).

For the iced version, the icing ingredients are:
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1}{\cup} 10$\boldsymbol\times$ sugar\\
    \SI{1/2}{\teaspoon} vanilla\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} milk
