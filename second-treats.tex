\section{Southern Pecan Pie\index{treats!southern pecan pie}}

\begin{open}
    Hey y'all from Martha, this is from an ancient out of print Better Homes and
    Garden Cookbook One can double the sin by brushing the crust with a dark
    chocolate glaze before adding the filling, but it's pretty wonderful as is!
    And so easy! Either a pie crust mix, or the real thing work equally well.
    The main thing is to have fresh pecans.
