\begin{open}
  This gazpacho recipe comes by way of Jen Tidey.  We were first
  introduced to it during the ``day after'' wedding brunch.  The amounts of
  ingredients are variable, so add to your personal taste preferences.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  celery \\
  peeled and seeded cucumbers \\
  scallions and/or onions \\
  red and green peppers \\
  minced garlic \\
  \num{\sim 6} tomatoes (canned are O.K.) \\
  \SI{\sim 1/2}{\cup} of red wine vinegar \\
  \SI{\sim 1/2}{\cup} of olive oil \\
  \numrange{1}{1}\SI{1/2}{\cup} tomato juice or \corp{V8} \\
  lemon juice \\
  black pepper \\
  Tabasco or cayenne pepper \\
  fresh cilantro
\end{ingredients}
Chop the celery, cucumbers onion, peppers, tomatoes, and garlic to a
consistency that you find happy.  A food processor may be used for ``soupy''
consistency.  Mix the red wine vinegar and olive oil (these should be in equal
amounts).  To this add the tomato juice (\corp{V8}).  Add lemon juice, black
pepper, Tabasco, and fresh cilantro.  Combine veggies and liquid ingredients
in a glass pitcher or other aesthetically pleasing container.  Chill for
several hours or overnight.  Serve with crunchy bread and a lightish red wine.

  \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} salt \\
  \SI{3/4}{\teaspoon} pepper \\
  \SI{1}{\cup} corn oil (or olive)
\end{ingredients}
The crouton ingredients are:

  \SI{4}{\tblspoon}  butter \\

\end{wrapfigure}
To make the salad dressing whisk the mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper in a
small bowl.  Gradually add oil.

To make the croutons preheat the oven to \SI{350}{\degree}.  Trim crusts (if
desired) and cut slices into \SI{1/2}{\inch} cubes.  Spread single layer on
tray, bake for \numrange{10}{15} minutes until dry and lightly brown.  Heat
butter in a skillet.  Add croutons and remaining ingredients and toss well.
Saut\'{e} \numrange{1}{2} minutes over medium heat and cool.  Kate says that
good salad stuffs are greenleaf or romaine lettuce with spinach.  Add tomatoes,
cucumber, and other salad stuff as your heart desires.  Another yummy thing is
to add pieces of chicken, ham, or turkey and other meats, which makes it taste
almost like a bite-sized sandwich.
