  This is a super-yummy cookie recipe sent in from Fermina.  She tells us that
  she always doubles this recipe when making a batch. Maybe the increased
  amounts of ingredients help the taste factor.  Either that or we're just
  gluttons.  Here's the recipe.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{3/4}{\cup} of shortening \\
  \SI{1}{\cup} sugar \\
  \SI{1/4}{\cup} light molasses \\
  1 slightly beaten egg \\
  \SI{2}{\cup} flour \\
  \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon}  salt \\
  \SI{1}{\teaspoon}  cinnamon \\
  \SI{2}{\teaspoon} soda \\
  \SI{1}{\teaspoon}  clove \\
  \SI{1/2}{\teaspoon} ginger
\end{ingredients}
Cream shortening and sugar, add molasses and egg.  Mix all dry ingredients.
Stir dry ingredients into creamed mixture.  Spoon into balls. Added step for
yumminess: \textit{Drop spoonfuls into sugar before putting on baking sheet}.
One spray of water before baking.  Bake \SI{350}{\degree} for \numrange{8}{10}
minutes.  The cookies should be split in the middle when finished.

  Mimi Horne brings us this delicious treat from an Italophile Brazilian Yale
  Art History Professor friend, Ester da Costa Meyer.  Those in less
  gastro-enlightened regions might need to replace the mascarpone with cream
  cheese and cream, and the Marsala with perhaps port or sherry.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  2-3 pkgs (about 24-30) lady fingers (boudoirs) \\
  \SI{3}{\cup} mascarpone (or part creme fraiche, part carre frais mushed together)\\
  3 egg yolks \\
  \SI{1/3}{\cup} sugar \\
  \SI{2}{\cup} strong coffee \\
  \SI{1/2}{\cup} or more Marsala wine \\
  \SI{1/2}{\cup} cocoa
\end{ingredients}
Prepare coffee and mix with Marsala. One at a time, dip lady fingers in
mixture briefly, then lay them in a row in an approx. \SI{10x18x2.5}{\inch}
deep serving dish.  Cut some to fit the remaining space in dish so that the
bottom is completely covered. Mix sugar, egg yolks and
mascarpone/cream. Spread about half the mixture over the first layer of
cookies to cover completely.  Dip more lady fingers in coffee/Marsala and lay
them over cream to form the next layer; cover remaining cream mixture. Dust
the top thoroughly with cocoa; chill overnight or for several hours before
serving. More cocoa may be added before serving. The texture can be made
lighter by beating the egg whites and folding them into the mascarpone
mixture, which also increases the amount.  Serves \numrange{6}{8}.

  southern cooking blood.  It's very easy and delicious, especially after a
  rich meal. It's cool, refreshing, and slides right down.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
  1 \corp{Graham Cracker Pie Crust}\\
  3 egg yolks\\
  \SI{2/3}[2]{\cup} sweetened condensed milk (2 cans)\\
  \SI{1}{\cup} plus \SI{2}{\tblspoon} lime juice (about 7 limes if you're
  squeezing)\\
  \SI{2}{\teaspoon} grated lime zest\\
  1 attractive lime
\end{ingredients}
Lightly whisk egg yolks in mixing bowl. Pour in condensed milk and whisk until
completely blended.  Add lime juice and zest and whisk to blend. Gently pour
filling into pie crust shell and smooth over top.  Refrigerate for at least 4
hours (don't skimp or it will be soup!). Slice the attractive lime paper thin
to garnish. I like to slice into half-circles and create a pinwheel pattern
around the center.
