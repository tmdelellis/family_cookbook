\begin{open}
    Lightly adapted, mostly for convenience, from ``Chef John's Creamy Mushroom
    Pasta'' on \url{www.allrecipes.com}, My family (who are NOT vegetarians) are
    totally satisfied with this quick and easy dish as a main course. From: Don
    and Geyi.
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1/2}{\pound} linguine, fettuccine or other pasta\\
    \SI{1}{\pound} mushrooms. I like a mix of white and shiitake, but baby
    portobello also work well\\
    Olive oil, salt pepper\\
    Garlic\\
    \SI{1}{\tblspoon} sherry\\
    Chicken stock (optional)\\
    \SI{1}{\cup} heavy whipping cream\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} grated parmesan cheese
\end{ingredients}
\Saute sliced mushrooms in olive oil until they are tender and release their
liquid. Add several cloves of diced garlic. Add sherry followed by heavy cream,
and lick residual cream from cup measure. Add salt and pepper and simmer cream
until the mixture thickens a bit and foams---though it does not get very thick;
if it does add some chicken stock. When the mixture reaches reasonable
consistency, stir in the fresh spices, turn off the heat and mix in the parmesan
cheese. Stir the mushroom cream mixture into the pasta and serve.
\end{entry}

\protip{
  Don and Geyi have never added fresh chopped thyme, chives, tarragon. But, the website recommends it, and they are sure it would improve the recipe.
}
\protip{
  For some reason Don often has dry vermouth (he likes Martinis apparently), and that works fine in place of sherry.

\begin{open}
    This is one of Julie's Simple/Quick/Tasty entries.  Chourico is similar to
    Spanish Chorizo, and I use only Gaspar's (and have found the meat department
    variety of chourico isn't as flavorful and spicy)---see
    Fig.~\ref{fig:chourico}. This is my go-to dinner!

    As a historical side-note, broccolini was developed in Japan and is a hybrid
    between broccoli and Chinese broccoli (Chinese kale).
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    Chourico (Gaspar's brand)\\
    broccolini
\end{ingredients}
Cut up raw broccolini (stems especially are so much sweeter than broccoli) and
place in wide soup bowl; microwave Chourico at 8 power for about
\SI{1.5}{\minute} to heat the meat through then cut into bite-size pieces.
Place on top of the broccolini and enjoy with a hearty red (I find a Malbec the
best accompaniment); some warmed sourdough baguette on the side or afterwards
with an excellent creamy French cheese doesn't hurt.

  From Julie Lindquist; this dish harmonizes well with a medium red or a
  hearty semi-sweet white. Tasty as an hors d'oeuvre but also great for a main
  dish.

\begin{ingredients}
    Portobello mushrooms\\
    fresh crabmeat\\

Using large or medium Portobellos, remove stems. Stuff caps with fresh
crabmeat (preferably not previously frozen; canned just doesn't do it!). Place
under broiler for a few minutes (5 or so) until lightly browned. Top with a
few slices of red pepper and a little curly parsley for color. Season with
salt and pepper at the table as desired.  (One could also add a little
Hellman's or homemade mayonnaise and/or finely chopped celery to the crab
before stuffing.)

  From Martha, this recipe is adapted from the Paoli Auxiliary cookbook
  ``Quilted Cuisine.'' Being able to get real Chesapeake Bay crab occasionally
  means I make these probably way too often. But so easy! Serves 4, so often
  just make half a recipe for the two of us. (NB: Kate decided we should do
  this cookbook mostly so we could get our hands on this recipe. Thanks,
  Mom!)

%%
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{1}{\pound} crab meat (lump works best)\\
  1 egg\\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} chopped parsley\\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} mayonnaise\\

Combine all these ingredients and mix well. Probably be quite moist. Shape
into patties (I like small ones for ease of turning). Coat with Panko or
regular bread crumbs mixed with a little Parmesan. Chill until ready to
cook. \Saute in medium hot olive oil until brown on both sides.  Serve on plate with lemon and parsley leaves (Fig.~\ref{fig:crab-cakes}).

\begin{open}
  From Mimi Horne, this recipe yields 4 servings and takes about 30 minutes to prepare. It looks like a good recipes for the young-ins to try. as there are not too many ingredients!
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper\\
    Several big leaves of romaine lettuce, Bibb lettuce or white cabbage\\
    1\SI{1/2}{\pound} thick white fish fillet (rockfish, cod, hake, snapper), in
    pieces about \SIrange[range-phrase={ to }]{3/4}{1}{\inch} thick,
    \SI{1}{\inch} wide, and \SI{2}{\inch} or less across\\
    \SI{1}{\cup} white wine\\
    \SIrange[range-phrase={ to }]{2}{3}{\tblspoon} butter
\end{ingredients}
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Take as many big, intact
leaves of lettuce or cabbage as you have pieces of fish. With large outer
leaves, cut out center veins 2 to 3 inches up from bottom of leaves, to the
point where the leaf is more pliable; with inner leaves this may not be
necessary. One or 2 at a time, blanch leaves in boiling water until they are
tender and flexible, 30 seconds to a minute. Remove and drain on paper towels.

Put a piece of fish on each leaf and sprinkle with salt and pepper; fold or roll
fish in leaf so edges overlap. It is not important to make a tight seal, but it
is nice if package covers all the fish. When done, you can cover and refrigerate
packages until ready to serve, or continue.

In a large, broad skillet or casserole with a cover, bring wine to a boil with
butter. Reduce heat to a simmer and add fish packages. Cover and simmer until a
thin-bladed knife easily penetrates fish, \SIrange{5}{10}{\minute}. Remove fish
to a warm platter.

Over high heat, quickly reduce liquid in skillet; it is likely there will be
more than there was when you started. When it is thickened a bit, pour over fish
and serve.

  Here's a recipe from Dave Lindquist, it sounds like it's from days in the
  Trauma Ward. Any vegetables can be omitted or substituted. Leftovers get
  combined in Tupperware or big yogurt container for tomorrow's lunch!
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    Rice (enough for leftovers for lunch)\\
    1 onion\\
    \numrange{2}{5} garlic cloves, depending on preference\\
    ginger root\\
    \numrange{1}{2} carrots\\
    1 handful of snow peas\\
    1 small/medium zucchini or yellow squash\\
    1 red pepper\\
    Protein: shrimp, chicken cutlets, beef strips, or tofu\\
    Spices as desired (salt, pepper, soy sauce, cumin, curry, etc.)\\
    Cooking oil
\end{ingredients}
Heat water for rice. Start low heat to cast iron skillet or wok. Mince garlic
coarsely. Begin chopping vegetables to bite-sized pieces, exact shape is up to
the chef. (If you chop onions last, your crying will interfere less with the
food prep.)

By now water for rice should be boiling. Add rice and simmer as per directions
on container. Usually \SIrange{15}{20}{\minute}. Turn up heat on skillet or
wok.

Finish chopping vegetables and protein. Lightly oil skillet/wok. It should be
smoking gently. \Saute onions, then peppers, then carrots, then squash, then
snow peas. Avoid overloading skillet/wok; it will stay hotter via cooking
smaller batches. Gently season each batch of vegetables as they cook. Combine
each batch of \sauteed vegetables to a large mixing bowl.

\Saute protein. Just before protein is ready, lower the heat, add the garlic,
and grate ginger into the skillet/wok. Add back in all the previously cooked
vegetables. Complete seasoning to taste. A dash of hot pepper will add some
kick.

By now your rice should be ready. Add salt, butter to taste. Fluff.

To serve, I prefer a bed of rice with the veggies and protein on top, drizzled
with soy sauce.

large baking dish with cover (or aluminum foil). Sprinkle garlic liberally on
fish Loosely place vegetables around fish; it's ok if they overflow onto the
fish. Drizzle olive oil all over fish and vegetables. Sprinkle with soy sauce.
Sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Place fish in oven with cover or foil.

By now water for rice should be boiling. Add rice and simmer as per packaging
directions (usually \SIrange{15}{20}{\minute}). Fish should cook for
approximately \SI{20}{\minute}, or until it looks firm and flaky. Remove cover
to speed cooking, if needed.

\begin{open}
  Kate normally avoids meatballs to avoid eating too much beef (and onions),
  but turkey meatballs just don't have the same zing (a.k.a. fat). So she
  altered a recipe from fine cooking to arrive at these rich---yet
  non-beef---meatballs. Serve with german egg noodles and a sweet side veggie
  like honey carrots or green beans for a complete meal! As with all of Kate's
  recipes, if you see onion powder in the ingredients, feel free to replace
  with \SI{1/2}cup minced onion.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    3 slides whole wheat bread (approx.)\\
    \SI{1/4}{\cup} milk (whole or 2\%) \\
    \SI{12}{\ounce} ground turkey, 93 or 99\% fat free\\
    \SI{12}{\ounce} pork sausage\\
    \SI{1}{\teaspoon} onion powder\\
    1 large egg, lightly beaten\\
    \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} ground allspice\\
    \SI{1/4}{\teaspoon} ground nutmeg\\
    \SI{1/2}{\teaspoon} each of Kosher salt and pepper\\
    \SI{2}{\tblspoon} butter\\
    \SI{2}{\tblspoon} olive oil\\
    \SI{1}{\tblspoon} flour\\
    \SI{1}{\cup} lower-salt chicken broth\\
    \SI{1/4}{\cup} heavy cream
\end{ingredients}
In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a bowl and use your
hands---works great!), soak the bread in the milk until softened, about 5
minutes. Mix on low speed until uniform, about 30 seconds. Add the turkey,
pork, onion powder, egg, allspice, nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix on low
speed until evenly combined. Using your hands (a bowl of water nearby helps
keep them from getting too gummed up), form about 25 \SI{1.5}{\inch} sized
balls. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add \SI{1}{\tblspoon}
each of the butter and oil. As soon as butter is melted, add half the
meatballs, turning very several minutes on several sides until browned, then
remove to a plate on the side. Repeat with the rest of the meatballs. Then
turn skillet heat to medium and add the other \SI{1}{\tblspoon} each of the
butter and oil. Add the flour and whisk it in with the fat until smooth. Whisk
in the chicken broth, then the cream, in small batches. The roux will first
become firmer as liquid is added but then become a thin sauce. Return all the
meatballs to the skillet and reduce the heat slightly, cover, and cook until
meatballs are cooked through and sauce thickens, about
\SIrange{8}{10}{\minute}. Season the sauce as needed with salt and pepper.

until its time to use in the lasagna, anytime more than 15 minutes or so. In a
separate and medium sized bowl, add the cheese layer ingredients and stir to
combine. Preheat oven to \SI{375}{\degreeF}. Next, arrange 3-4 lasagna noodles

\begin{entry}{Braised Pork in Soy Sauce, ``Pork Candy''}{Second Edition}
\index{Liu!Geyi}
\index{Pork!braised pork in soy sauce}

\begin{open}
  From Geyi, who writes:

  This is a common household dish in China, it is in every child's memory as one of their favorites of their mom's. Every family has its own way of making it. In general, there are regional differences in the ingredients: families in the south like to use carameled soy sauces for a dark color, Northern families do
  not think much of the color, and only use rock crystal sugar for the caramel effect.

  I remember my mom’s, she poaches the pork first and does not put other things
  with her meat. My aunt’s family in Beijing put tofu in the pot, which soaked
  up the meat juice and flavors and tended to be even more sought-after than the
  meat. Our ayi (nanny) in Shanghai added boiled eggs to it to the same effect.

  I cook it sometimes this way, and sometimes that way. They all come through well. Some say it tastes better the day after, but we never had the chance to test the theory---it is always gone the first day. My current standard is a variation from ``Miss Vegetable's gourmet cooking diary'' a WeChat channel that uses black tea to cut through the grease. ``Miss Vegetable'' started cooking for herself and friends, then got so popular that she started her own company with staff and everything.

  \begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}红烧肉\end{CJK*} is the name of the dish. Literally translated it means ``red roast pork;'' a more common translation is Braised Pork in Soy Sauce---neither captures the image, experience or culture. I cooked this dish for Martha's birthday 2019, and it is she who was able to give this dish a proper name---Pork Candy!
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
  \SI{2}{\pound} pork belly with skin (Fig.~\ref{fig:pork-candy-ingredients})\\
  Rock Crystal sugar\\
  \numrange{3}{5} pieces of sliced ginger\\
  \SI{3}{\tblspoon} Chinese cooking wine (or sherry)\\
  \SI{3}{\tblspoon} soy sauce (\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}生抽\end{CJK*})\\
  \SI{2}{\tblspoon} dark soy sauce (regular soy sauce with an additional
  caramelization step. Used often for cooking meat to give it a darker color and
  maybe more complex flavor.)\\
  black tea
\end{ingredients}
%%
Before starting cut the pork belly into \SI{1}{\inch} cubes and make a large pot
of hot tea.  The cooking instructions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Heat a pan with lid on low. Add the meat without adding oil. Cook the
    meat slowly on low until the oil seeps out, then turn the pieces one by one
    to cook the other side (Fig.~\ref{fig:pork-candy-prep}a).
    \item When the surfaces are all slightly browned and the oil has leaked out,
    add rock sugar and stir fry until it is completely dissolved
    (Fig.~\ref{fig:pork-candy-prep}b).
    \item Add ginger slices, bay leaves, dried chili, then pour rice wine, dark
    soy sauce and light soy sauce, and stir fry evenly
    (Fig.~\ref{fig:pork-candy-prep}c).
    \item Pour the hot tea into the pot, make sure there is enough to cover the
    meat. Bring the liquid to a boil, then simmer for one hour.
    \item Uncover, turn heat to high, stir till the liquid caramelizes, coats
    the meat cubes and shines (Fig.~\ref{fig:pork-candy-prep}d).

Given that Ratatouille is a classic French dish, we tell the story here from Paul Horne about Mimi's efforts on ``Le Cookbook,'' from where she first published this recipe. She illustrated the cover, a drawing of her and Paul's Paris apartment kitchen shown in figure \ref{fig:lecookbook}, as well as many of the drawings throughout the book.

Paul sent a wonderful summary of Mimi's volunteer work that involved this cookbook, so we include some of his notes here:

Mimi was a volunteer at the American Hospital of Paris from the early 1980s until we moved to London in 1998. The volunteers
provide services in what is one of Europe's best and chic-est hospitals. Founded in 1906, AHP played a crucial role in the world wars and is today a high-tech healthcare center in France. One of the volunteers' most successful projects was "Le Cookbook", a bilingual volume with recipes in English and American measures on the right hand page and in French with French measures on the left page. First published in 1976, Le Cookbook was a great success, contributing financially to AHP. By the early 1990s all copies had been sold so Mimi volunteered to lead a group of volunteers to do a second edition. This proved to be an intensive job of culling, updating and adding recipes and ideas (editor's note: don't we know it!!). But the second edition of "Le Cookbook" was published in 1998, not long after we got to London, and has been a success although sales are now limited to the hospital itself since the French did not want it to "compete" with French cookbooks !

With that, here is the showcase of the recipes we received from ``Le cookbook.''
This dish is best prepared ahead so the flavors have time to blend.

\begin{ingredients}
  5 tomatoes (or a large can), cut in slices\\
  2 eggplants, sliced, not peeled \\
  2 zucchini, sliced \\
  1 red pepper, cut in strips \\
  1 green pepper, cut in strips \\
  4 small onions, chopped \\
  2 cloves garlic, crushed \\
  Tabasco sauce \\
  \SI{1}{\tblspoon} \emph{herbes de Provence} \\
  5 bay leaves \\
  salt and pepper \\
  \SI{4}{\tblspoon} olive oil
\end{ingredients}
%%
Salt eggplant slices and place a weight on top to make them disgorge their liquid. After an hour, rinse, dry and fry them in olive oil a few at a time, leaving them to dry on paper towels. In a small amount of oil, cook the onions, garlic, peppers, and zucchini, putting aside each vegetable when it is softened. In a large oven dish make layers of all ingredients, adding to each layer tomato slices, salt, pepper, dash of Tabasco, bay leaf, and \emph{herbes de Provence}. Bake uncovered at \SI{350}{\degreeF} for 45 minutes. May be served hot or tepid.
%%
\protip{\emph{herbes de Provence} is not the same as Italian seasoning, which is
actually an American invention.  You can make your own by combining marjoram,
rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, savory, and Bay leaf.}

From Katie Pross, here is a delicious quick-and-easy Asian-inspired dinner ready in 20 minutes. Serves 8.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
  \SIrange{1}{1/2}{\pound} flank steak, trimmed of fat and sliced very thin against the grain\\
  \SI{1/2} cup low sodium soy sauce\\
  \SI{3}{\tblspoon} cooking or drinking sherry\\
  \SI{2}{\tblspoon} brown sugar \\
  \SI{2}{\tblspoon} cornstarch \\
  \SI{2}{\teaspoon} minced fresh ginger\\
  \SI{8}{\ounce} snow peas, ends trimmed \\
   5 whole scallions, cut into half-inch pieces on the diagonal \\
  salt as needed \\
    \SI{3}{\tblspoon} peanut or olive oil \\
  crushed red pepper for sprinkling \\

\end{ingredients}

%%
In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, cornstarch, and ginger. Pour half the liquid over the sliced meat in a bowl and toss. Reserve the other half of the liquid. Set aside.

Heat oil in a heavy skillet (recommend iron) or wok over high heat. Add snow peas and stir for 45 seconds. Remove to a separate plate and set aside.

Allow pan to get very hot again. With tongs, add half the meat mixture, leaving most of the marinade still in the bowl. Add half the scallions. Spread out meat as you add it to the pan but do not stir it for a good minute. Turn the meat to the other side and cook for another 30 seconds and remove to a clean plate. Repeat with the other half of the meat after pan is hot again. Then add first half of meat back to the pan with the second, the rest of the marinade, and the snow peas. Check to see if it needs more salt. Mixture will thicken as it sits.

Serve immediately with cooked jasmine or other long-grained rice. Sprinkle with crushed flakes as desired.
