\textsl{Lightly adapted, mostly for convenience, from ``Chef John's Creamy
Mushroom Pasta'' on \url{allrecipes.com}, My family (who are NOT vegetarians)
are totally satisfied with this quick and easy dish as a main course. From: Don and Gege}.
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1/2}{\pound} linguine, fettuccine or other pasta\\
    \SI{1}{\pound} mushrooms. I like a mix of white and shiitake, but baby
    portobello also work well\\
    Olive oil, salt pepper\\
    Garlic\\
    \SI{1}{\tblspoon} sherry (For some reason, I more often have dry vermouth
    which seems to work fine.) \\
    Chicken stock (optional)\\
    \SI{1}{\cup} heavy whipping cream\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} grated parmesan cheese\\
    Fresh chopped thyme, chives, tarragon (n.b. I have never added these. I'm
    sure  they would make it better.)\\
\end{ingredients}
Saute sliced mushrooms in olive oil until they are tender and release their
liquid. Add several cloves of diced garlic. Add sherry followed by heavy cream,
and lick residual cream from cup measure. Add salt and pepper and simmer cream
until the mixture thickens a bit and foams---though it does not get very thick;
if it does add some chicken stock. When the mixture reaches reasonable
consistency, stir in the fresh spices, turn off the heat and mix in the parmesan
cheese. Stir the mushroom cream mixture into the pasta and serve.
