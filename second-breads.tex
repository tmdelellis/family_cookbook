\begin{open}
    Hey, anything that's not very French I love.  Also, are crepes (or
    cr\^{e}pes as I know some of you will insist, even though both spellings are
    valid), breads, deserts, or main dishes?  Who knows, who cares, we put them
    here.

    As Don and Gege say, ``The crepes are but a vesssel for whatever good stuff
    you put into the filling.''  We could not agree more.

    This is a recipe derived from \url{allrecipes.com}; it is absolutely
    foolproof, at least according to Don and Gege
\end{open}
\begin{ingredients}
    \SI{1}{\cup} flour\\
    2 eggs\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} milk\\
    \SI{1/2}{\cup} water\\
    dash of salt\\
    \SI{2}{\tblspoon} melted butter
\end{ingredients}
Beat the eggs and mix thoroughly into the flour. Add milk and water and beat as
long as you can or until no lumps. Add salt and beat in melted butter. It's a
very thin batter---don't be alarmed. Drop small ladlefuls into a skillet and
rotate so the batter coats the bottom in a very thin layer; no oil needed after
the first one. Makes \numrange{8}{10} crepes.

\minisection{Filling}

\noindent No measurements here; use the Force and whatever you have handy
\begin{ingredients}
    Half pound to a pound ground meat or sausage\\
    A little soy sauce---dark is better than light\\
    Diced onion\\
    Chopped tomatoes---\numrange{1}{2} large or several small
\end{ingredients}
The above three ingredients are the base, add other things as convenient and to take the filling in different directions---mushrooms, spinach, chopped peppers, parmesan cheese are all good.

Brown the ground meat/sausage in oil, add a little soy sauce for flavor and
color. Add onion and cook until tender and transparent. If you have mushrooms,
peppers, etc. add them and saut\'{e}. Add tomatoes last and saut\'{e} until you
have a thick sauce or paste. If you are using spinach or cheese stir them in
right before serving.

Put a plate of crepes and a big bowl of sauce on the table and let people roll
their own. Crepes are tender and knife and fork are usually required.

    For those of you geographically challenged, or at the least, not familiar with the geography of Malta, Gozo is a small island just north of the main island of Malta.  This spread comes from Alison Rona.
