\section{Three Kings Bread (and St. Nick)\index{breads!Three Kings Bread}}

\textit{Is this the real name or is it because it comes from three Kings?  This
is a recipe supplied to us from Rich, Jen and Julian King (Nicholas arrived
after the project began-hence the name).  This recipe makes one loaf.}
\begin{ingredients}
1/4 cup plus one Tbsp. sour cream \\
1 tsp. baking soda \\
1/2 cup butter at room temperature \\
1 cup sugar \\
2 eggs lightly beaten \\
1 ripe mashed banana and 1 medium apple (2 bananas an option) \\
1/2 tsp. baking powder \\
1 cup chopped nuts \\
1/2 tsp. cardamom \\
1 zest of lemon \\
1 tsp. vanilla extract
\end{ingredients}
Preheat the oven to \oven{350}.  Grease a $9''\times 5''$ loaf pan.  
Combine sour
cream and baking soda in small bowl.  Set aside (it will foam).  Cream butter
and sugar in a small bowl.  Beat in eggs, fruit, and sour cream mixture. 
Slowly mix in all dry ingredients.  Bake until a toothpick inserted into center
comes out sort of clean and loaf is golden brown.  This should be about 1 hour.
 
Cool 10 minutes in pan. Turn loaf out onto rack and cool completely.  Eat
thinking of your most favorite Kings. . .

\section{Kate's Standard Bagels\index{breads!bagels}}

\textit{This is a recipe by Kate that she picked up in Washington, 
D.C. during a 91'--92' winter internship at NIST from Dr. Lucatorto.  
We enjoy this  one a lot (especially in the south where getting good bagels 
is not always easy). Note: you need a food processor for this recipe. It
makes 16 bagels}.
\begin{ingredients}
2 packets yeast \\
2 scant Tbsp. sugar\\
\meas{3\,1/2} cups warm water with salt \\
Lots (several lbs) of flour
\end{ingredients}
Combine yeast, sugar, and water.  Add $\sim$2 cups flour to 
food processor. Pour in water mixture until a dough is formed 
(stop pouring when processor begins to ``growl.'' Listen you'll hear it). 
Remove dough to a
casserole dish with lid. Repeat until all mixture is used.  Microwave dish at
30~\% for 3 minutes.  Let rise  for 30~minutes.  Punch down roll into loaf, cut
in 16 pieces and  make into bagels. Kate uses a doughnut stamper. Let rise
30~minutes. In large frying pan, set 2" water to boil.  Boil bagels for
10~seconds each side.  Place on greased cookie sheet and bake 30~minutes or
until lightly brown at 350$^{\circ}$. If you want to add extras such as 
cinnamon or raisins, add when processor starts to growl. If you would
like toppings such as seasame seeds, brush bagel with egg white and
sprinkle on top just before baking.

\section{Kate's Super Stromboli Dough\index{breads!stromboli}}

\textit{This is a recipe by Kate.  While this 
recipe is intended for stromboli or calzone it also makes a fine pizza 
dough\index{breads!pizza dough}.
The recipe serves 6}.
\begin{ingredients}
4 scant cups flour \\
1 package \corp{Quick Rise} yeast \\
1 tsp. salt \\
1 Tbsp. sugar \\
1\,1/3 cup warm water \\
1/4 cup oil
\end{ingredients}
In mixing bowl combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.  Add water and oil and 
form a soft dough. Add flour or water as necessary.  Let rise 30 minutes,
then punch down (you can freeze at this point to thaw later in microwave).
Roll into 4-6 circles (depending on crowd hunger). Add your favorite toppings,
including sauce if desired, and of course cheese. Possible fillings are 
broccoli (a Kate favorite), spinach,  pepperoni, ham, onions, mushrooms, and
almost anything edible you  can think of. Bake at 400$^{\circ}$ for 12--15
minutes until golden  brown. 

\section{Kuchen\index{breads!kuchen}}

\textit{This is a coffeecake made by Fermina Evans for the Evans family every
Christmas morning. She always makes a double batch and it's still barely
enough! Don't be fooled by its location in the ``breads'' section; its
definitely a treat!}.

\begin{ingredients}
1/4 cup shortening\\
1 cup sugar \\
1 egg \\
1/2 cup milk \\
1 1/2 cup flour \\
2 tsp. baking powder \\
salt to taste 
\end{ingredients}
The topping:
\begin{ingredients}
1/2 cup sugar \\
1/3 cup flour \\
1 tsp. cinnamon \\
dash salt
1/4 cup butter \\
\end{ingredients}
Preheat oven to \oven{350}. Cream shortening and sugar. Add egg and mix well.
Add flour and milk. Pour into greased and floured 9" round or 8" square baking
pan. Combine the rest of the topping ingredients except butter. Then, cut
butter into topping mixture and sprinkle on top of batter. Bake for 20-25
minutes (test with toothpick for doneness).

\section{Weedie's Blueberry Muffins\index{breads!blueberry muffins}}

\textit{No joke, Don and Kate (and surely David and Steve) used to beg Weedie to
make these muffins every time we visited. And she always did. Martha and Dodge
say, ``Oh Heaven, these and some Lobster salad!'' They are perfection, we
promise you. Just make the effort to get quality blueberries. We recommend
going to Maine to get them}.

\begin{ingredients}
2 scant cups flour\\
3 tsp. baking powder\\
1/2 cup sugar\\
1/2 tsp. salt\\
1/2 stick butter, melted (1/4 cup)\\
2 eggs\\
1 cup milk\\
1 cup bluberries (little wild ones are best)\\
sugar\\
cinnamon
\end{ingredients}
Preheat oven to \oven{400}. Weedie says, ``Usually I wash the berries awhile
before using them, so they can dry off before being added.'' In mixing bowl
combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Mix butter eggs and milk in a
separate bowl. Pour this over the flour mixture and stir until smooth. Add
blueberries, stir gently, and spoon into buttered muffin tins. Sprinkle with
sugar and cinnamon and bake for 20-25 minutes.
