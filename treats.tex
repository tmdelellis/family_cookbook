\section{Fermina's Ginger Snaps\index{treats!gingersnaps}}

\textit{This is a super-yummy cookie recipe sent in from
Fermina.  She tells us that she always doubles this 
recipe when making a batch. Maybe the
increased amounts of ingredients help the taste factor.  Either that or we're
just gluttons.  Here's the recipe.}

1 cup sugar \\ 
1/4 cup light molasses \\ 
1 slightly beaten egg \\

and egg.  Mix all dry ingredients.  Stir dry ingredients into creamed mixture. 
Spoon into balls. Added step for yumminess:  \textit{Drop spoonfulls into sugar
before putting on baking sheet}.  One spray of water before baking.  Bake
350$^{\circ}$ for 8 to 10 minutes.  The cookies should be split in the middle
when finished.

\section{Tiramisu\index{treats!tiramisu}}

\textit{Mimi Horne brings us this delicious treat from an
Italophile Brazilian Yale Art History Professor friend, Ester da Costa Meyer.
Those in less gastro-enlightened regions might need to replace the mascarpone
with cream cheese and cream, and the Marsala with perhaps port or sherry. }
\begin{ingredients}
2-3 pkgs (about 24-30) lady fingers (boudoirs) \\
3 cups mascarpone (or part creme fraiche, part carre frais mushed together)\\
3 egg yolks \\
1/3 cup sugar \\
2 cups strong coffee \\
1/2 cup or more Marsala wine \\
1/2 cup cocoa
\end{ingredients}
Prepare coffee and mix with Marsala. One at a time, dip lady fingers in mixture
briefly, then lay them in a row in an approx. $10''\times 18''\times 2 1/2''$
deep serving dish.
Cut some to fit the remaining space in dish so that the bottom is
completely covered. Mix sugar, egg yolks and mascarpone/cream. Spread
about half the mixture over the first layer of cookies to cover completely.
Dip more lady fingers in coffee/Marsala and lay them over cream to form the
next layer; cover remaining cream mixture. Dust the top thoroughly with cocoa;
chill overnight or for several hours before serving. More cocoa may be added
before serving. The texture can be made lighter by beating the egg whites and
folding them into the mascarpone mixture, which also increases the amount.
Serves 6-8.

\section{Tortelettes\index{treats!Tortelettes}}

\textit{Another Nonnie/Grandpatty and Joy of Cooking original. Niepold kids
remember Christmas at Lee St. when they eat Tortelettes and California dates
stuffed with Georgia Pecans and rolled in confectioners' sugar.}
\begin{ingredients}
1 grated lemon rind\\
1 cup sugar\\
3/4 cup butter\\
2 egg yolks \\
1/2 cup bread flour \\
1 cup blanched and shredded almonds or pecan pieces \\
1/3 cup sugar \\
1 tsp. cinnamon\\
1/4 tsp. nutmeg\\
1/8 tsp. salt\\
1 egg white\\
1 Tbsp water
\end{ingredients}
Preheat oven to \oven{375}. Grate lemon into sugar. Cream sugar with butter and
beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Add flour gradually to make a stiff
dough. Pinch off about a teaspoonful of dough at a time. Roll it into a ball
and flatten on cookie sheet until very thin. Prepare nuts and combine with
next 4 ingredients (spices). Beat the egg white and water together slightly.
Brush the cakes with the egg white mixture, then sprinkle nut/spice mixture
and bake until light brown.  

\section{Lime Cream Pie\index{treats!Lime Cream Pie}}

\textit{Kate got this recipe from Edie, a receptionist at Bryn Mawr College
with southern cooking blood. 
It's very easy and delicious, especially after a rich
meal. It's cool, refreshing, and slides right down.}
\begin{ingredients}
1 Graham Cracker Pie Crust\\
3 egg yolks\\
2 2/3 cups sweetened condensed milk (2 cans)\\
1 cup plus 2 Tbsp lime juice (about 7 limes if you're squeezing)\\
2 tsp. grated lime zest\\
1 attractive lime
\end{ingredients}
Lightly whisk egg yolks in mixing bowl. Pour in
condensed milk and whisk until completely blended.  Add lime juice and zest and
whisk to blend. Gently pour filling into pie crust shell and smooth over top.
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (don't skimp or it will be soup!). Slice
the attractive lime paper thin to garnish. I like to slice into
half-circles and create a pinwheel pattern around the center.
