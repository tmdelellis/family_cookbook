\section{White Grapes and Sweetened ``Cream''\index{sides!white grapes and
sweetened cream}}

\begin{open}
Here is a refreshing and simple summery side submitted by Julie Lindquist.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    grapes\\
    plain yogurt or sour cream\\
    brown sugar
\end{ingredients}
Remove grapes from stems; rinse and dry. Place in a colorful serving dish. Top
with plain yogurt or sour cream (NB: sweet cream doesn't offer the contrast to
the sweet grape taste). Sprinkle some brown sugar on top. Refrigerate for at
least 4 hours; the attractive pattern of the dissolving brown sugar is a
bonus. Lasts a few days, if thereâ€™s any left.

\section{Boursin Potatoes\index{sides!boursin potatoes}}

\begin{open}
    From Martha: a favorite side from Barby Buckman at St.~Peter's in the Great
