  Here is a refreshing and simple summery side submitted by Julie Lindquist.
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}
    grapes\\
    plain yogurt or sour cream\\
    brown sugar
\end{ingredients}
Remove grapes from stems; rinse and dry. Place in a colorful serving dish. Top
with plain yogurt or sour cream (NB: sweet cream doesn't offer the contrast to
the sweet grape taste). Sprinkle some brown sugar on top. Refrigerate for at
least 4 hours; the attractive pattern of the dissolving brown sugar is a
bonus. Lasts a few days, if thereâ€™s any left.

\index{Liu!Geyi}

\begin{open}
  Submitted by Geyi, this is a dish often seen in Southern Chinese restaurants. It is often crisp and green in restaurants but soggy and dark at home. The secret is to boil the lettuce leaves very fast (5-10 seconds) in a large amount of water so that they stays green and crisp while keeping in all the nutrition 
\end{open}
%%
\begin{ingredients}

\end{ingredients}
Prepare sauce by mixing what you think is a good amount of oyster sauce, soy sauce, salt, sugar, (corn) starch, water together. Ask Geyi for tips on the right amount; she was busy moving when when we were entering this, but it sounded so good we included it anyway!

\end{figure}

Next cook the lettuce as follows: Take a large pot of water, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil. Add lettuce, stir so that all areas get blanched, and take out after 5-10 seconds (refer to figure \ref{fig:lettuce2} to see how the lettuce is still quite green).

Then, heat oil in a pot, add chopped garlic and stir until it becomes yellow, and add the sauce mixture and stir until it thickens. 

Finally, pour the sauce over the lettuce and serve immediately.
